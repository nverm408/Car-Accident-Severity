# Car-Accident-Severity
A group project created by Sneha Jacob, Jasmine Ly, Navya Verma, Lasya Nagisetty, Christopher Hartsfield.

# Description
We used a dataset from Kaggle that chronicled over 7 million car accidents along with features such as temperature, wind speed, etc. Using a KNN Cluster machine learning model, we used 6 features (including: temperature, wind speed, distance, humidity, precipitation, and visibility) to train our model and predict our target variable, which was accident severity. 

We had to use a randomly selected 5% of the original dataset to allow our computers to process the code within an acceptable amount of time for our group project/presentation. As a result, using this model may have varying results.
